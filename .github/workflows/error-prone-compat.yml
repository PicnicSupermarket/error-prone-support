# Validates compatibility with the latest Error Prone release.
#
# XXX: This workflow compiles the code against the `LATEST` Error Prone release
# as determined by Maven, and subsequently runs the unit tests. No other checks
# are performed. This guards against false positives, but is not quite as
# thorough as the validation performed by
# `website/generate-version-compatibility-overview.sh`. Consider unifying these
# approaches.
# XXX: Instead of the `LATEST` release, this workflow could also attempt to
# build against the `1.0-HEAD-SNAPSHOT` version published to the Sonatype
# snapshot repository. This would enable advance notification of upcoming
# incompatibilities.
