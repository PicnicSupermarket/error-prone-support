# Error Prone Support website

This directory contains the majority of the source code that powers
[error-prone.picnic.tech][error-prone-support-website]. The website is
statically generated using [Jekyll][jekyll].

# Local development

To view the website on `localhost`, first follow the [Jekyll installation
instructions][jekyll-docs-installation]. Once done, in this directory execute:

```sh
bundle install
../generate-docs.sh && bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

The website will now be [available][localhost-port-4000] on port 4000. Source
code modifications (including the result of rerunning `../generate-docs.sh`)
will automatically be reflected. (An exception is `_config.yml`: changes to
this file require a server restart.) Subsequent server restarts do not require
running `bundle install`, unless `Gemfile` has been updated in the interim.

If you are not familiar with Jekyll, be sure to check out its
[documentation][jekyll-docs]. It is recommended to follow the provided
step-by-step tutorial.

###### Switch Ruby versions

The required Ruby version is set in `.ruby-version`. To switch, you can use
[rvm][rvm] to manage your Ruby version.

###### Resolve Bundler issues

On macOS, you may get an error such as the following when running `bundle
install`:

```sh
fatal error: 'openssl/ssl.h' file not found
```

In that case, run:

```sh
bundle config build.eventmachine --with-cppflags="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include"
bundle install
```

# Deployment

The website is regenerated and deployed using the
[`deploy-website.yaml`][error-prone-support-website-deploy-workflow] GitHub
Actions workflow any time a change is merged to `master`.
