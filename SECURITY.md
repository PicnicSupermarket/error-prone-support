# Security policy

We take security seriously. We are mindful of Error Prone Support's place in
the software supply chain, and the risks and responsibilities that come with
this.

## Supported versions

This project uses [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning]. In general, only
the latest version of this software is supported. That said, if users have a
compelling reason to ask for patch release of an older major release, then we
will seriously consider such a request. We do urge users to stay up-to-date and
use the latest release where feasible.

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please visit the [security
advisories][security-advisories] page and click _Report a vulnerability_. We
will take such reports seriously and work with you to resolve the issue in a
timely manner.
